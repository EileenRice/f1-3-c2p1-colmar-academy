This is the capstone project for Codecademy. The subject was to design a website for a fiction school, called Colmar Academy.

It was a very challenging project as I am still learning new skills and abilities.

I wanted to (and may in the near future) do something for tablet sizes, but with no wireframe given, I felt a bit hesitant to do so.
